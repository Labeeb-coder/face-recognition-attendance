# 📸 Face Recognition Attendance System

Automated attendance tracking solution using **AI-powered facial recognition**.  
This system detects employees in real-time and logs attendance automatically, making it ideal for offices, classrooms, and organizations looking to **digitize attendance management**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Manual attendance tracking is time-consuming and error-prone.  
This project leverages **computer vision** and **deep learning** to:

- Detect and recognize employee faces in real-time
- Automatically record attendance in a CSV log
- Provide a scalable solution for adding new employees or datasets
- Minimize manual errors and improve workplace efficiency

**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, face_recognition, NumPy, Pandas

pip install -r requirements.txt
🎯 Key Features
Real-Time Attendance Tracking: Automatically logs employees as they appear in front of the camera

Facial Recognition Accuracy: Uses deep learning for reliable face detection and matching

Data Logging: Stores attendance records in attendance.csv with timestamps

Scalable Dataset: Easily add or remove employee images from the dataset/ folder

User-Friendly: Run with minimal setup using Python scripts

🧰 Usage
1️⃣ Encode Known Faces
bash
Copy
Edit
python encode_faces.py
Scans all images in dataset/

Saves face encodings in encodings/ for recognition

2️⃣ Run Real-Time Attendance
bash
Copy
Edit
python real_time_face_recognition.py
Opens webcam feed

Detects faces and matches with known encodings

Logs attendance in attendance.csv

📊 Outputs
attendance.csv – Employee name, date, and time of attendance

encodings/ – Preprocessed face encodings for faster recognition

Real-time webcam display showing detected faces with names

💡 How It Works
Dataset Preparation: Store employee images in the dataset/ folder (name files as John_Doe.jpg)

Face Encoding: encode_faces.py generates numerical representations of faces

Recognition & Logging: real_time_face_recognition.py detects faces via webcam and compares with encodings

Attendance Tracking: Attendance is recorded automatically with timestamps in CSV
